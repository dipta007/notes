## Monolith vs Microservices

#### Problems of Mololith

1. Technology Dependency
2. Engineering Focus
3. Scaling Data Layer
4. Overloaded VM/Containers
5. CI/CD tests, build & conflicts
6. Understanding the code for new devs



#### Advantages of Microservice

1. Scaling easy
2. Deploy easy
3. Different Technology usage
4. Faster to develop and understand
5. Loosely Coupled



#### Disadvantages of Microservice

1. Inter Process Communication
2. Distributed transactions
3. More resources
4. Debugging issues



## Scale Cube

#### Functional Decomposition

On the functional decomposition, we can devide our functions more. Like we have a product service which could search and list product. We can decompose it into two different services, one for search and another for listing.

#### Data Partioning

We can devide our data into different partions. Like using the first letter of usernames, we can partition the data into A-B, C-X, Y-Z. So if I have a get or post request on user B, we will use the first db and for the user D, we will use the 2nd DB.

#### Horizontal Scaling

On that part, we can make our servers bigger. By using more cores or more rams. But obviously there is a hard limit to it. So it is not always recommended.



## API Gateway

Front facing service for all the microservices. Frontend will call the API Gateway and API will transfer it to the dedicated service. There can be 2 scenerios

1. Frontend will call API Gateway n times to get n information about one single element (N number of API)
2. Frontend will call API Gateway once and the API gateway will call n services and compose all the data to the Frontend. Its also API Composition.



Another version of API Gateway can be **Backend For Frontend (BFF)**, where for mobile, web or third party will get different API gateway.



#### Advanteages

1. **Authentication** can be done on the API Gateway
2. **SSL Termination**. Maybe the Frontend calls the API Gateway with HTTPS. But the API gateway can call other services using only HTTP / WS / HTTPS / RPC
3. **Load Balancer**: API gateway can act as the load balancer for the N services
4. **Insulation**: Client has no direct access to all the microservices and those can be changed anytime w/o the change of client code
5. Can also help on - 
   1. Caching
   2. Managing access quotas
   3. API health monitoring
   4. API versioning
   5. Chaos monkey testing
   6. A/B testing



#### Disadvaantages

1. Complicated
2. High latency



## Service Registry

There are two ways a microserive can register his ip and port on the server register

1. **Self**: When the service begins, it will register it self on the database
2. **Third Party**: Service Register will constantly monitor the cluster and when a service spawns, the SR heaars it and register the service



## Service Discovery

There are two ways the service registry can be discovered - 

1. **Client**: Client can directly connect with service registry to get the config of the services. In that case the client need to pull the data after a definite time. It is not recommended as the number of connections to the SR will be huge
2. **Server**: On this patter, API Gateway will connect with the SR to get the updated config. (**Recommended**)
