# How to Read

There are two thing you have to do to be good at IELTS Reading

1. Skimming
2. Scanning

You have to first skim thorough the paragraph. And later when you get the question then you will scan the paragraph to get the answer.

## How to Skim

Skimming is the way to get the gist out of a paragraph. To skim you have to do 2 things.

1. Look at words not sentences
2. Read the first & last sentence of a paragraph and identify the topic of the paragraph


## How to Scan

Scanning is the way to find the answer of a question. The steps are -

* Identify 1-2 keywords from the question
* Look for keywords, synonyms, paraphases
    * Not read the full sentence
    * Keep the eye on the middle of the page
* When you find the keyword, read the surrounding sentences.
