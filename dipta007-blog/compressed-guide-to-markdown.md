For many days I wanted to start a blog site. But due to my good grasp on procrastination, I cannot but start it. But in the last few days, I got a good push to start a new blog. So I went up, sat in front of my PC and went to [GoDaddy.com](https://www.godaddy.com/). And I found the www.dipta007.com available :D. I used my last two days to set up the WordPress blog. And now it is somewhat completed. I will write another post about it another time.

Whatever, to start a new blog, at the first I need to write posts. And for that, the easiest way was to learn markdown language which is used in Github README.md. `.md` extension stands for MarkDown. So I spent an evening to learn that. And this blog is regarding it. It will be a really compressed list of markdown syntaxes. If you want a more detailed overview, follow on the reference links at the end of this post.

Markdown is somehow like HTML. You will use some syntax and it will render the page according to the specified commands. But the pros of markdown over HTML is that it is more human-readable and can be learnt under 10-20 minutes. Most of the syntaxes are self-explanatory. If you found anything tough to understand, please comment. I will edit the post with more details.
