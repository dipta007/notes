# VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

## What is VPC?
VPC is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. It is logically isolated from other virtual networks in AWS.

## What is Subnet?
A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC. You can launch resources into your VPC.

Two type of subnets - 
1. Public Subnet
2. Private Subnet

### Public Subnet
Public subnet is used where the resources need to be connected to the internet.

### Private Subnet
Private subnet should be used where the resources won't be connected to internet.
