## Placement groups
Placement is a logical grouping in an availability zone. It is used when we need network latency or high network throughput or both.

* First you create placement group and then create EC2 on the placement group.
* AWS suggests to create all the instances on one single launch request.
* There is no charge in placement group.
* If you receive a capacity error stop all instances and run all once again. Restarting might take all the instances to a hardware which has that capacity.
* It wont be on multiple availability zone.

## AWS Volumes
1. Root volume / Instance Store / Temporary Storage / Ephemeral Volume
2. EBS / Elastic Block Store.
