## Reserve Instance
Reserve instances for a specific time. The cost is low in that case.

## Volume Add
1. Add volume from Elastic Block Storage
2. Mount them in the ubuntu server by below commands

```
lsblk
sudo file -s /dev/xvdf
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf
sudo mkdir /newvolume
sudo mount /dev/xvdf /newvolume/
cd /newvolume
df -h .
```

## Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
After setup a server, create an image so that we can boot from that iamge later on and go to that state without any hassle. Each AMI will create a snapshot with it.

`It will cost money but pretty less for the snapshot`

## Elastic IP
It's static IP. So that I can allocate a fixed IP and attach to it to an instance so that it won't change ever.

`It will cost money and its pretty much`


## Web server architecture
* 5-10 Small small web servers (general purpose) that only serves HTML, CSS, JS. (10 t2.micro is okay)
* Memory Optimized database server
* Compute optimized CPU server for backend
* Bucket for data storage
* Optional: DynamoDB for session management

## Load Balancer
Load balancer is used to serve data from different servers. As web servers are used to serve data and images, the bandwidth IO is really blocked. So it will be helpful to use load balancer and redirect to different servers so that servers are not busy.
